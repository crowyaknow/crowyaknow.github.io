                    6/11/22: walking home, armed with 2!! loafs of gf bread and the shame of a failed conversation with the cashier, i thought to myself, 
                    "how could i feel sad when the sky and trees look like this?" - truthfully, how I could I fall into despair with the air shaking idly around 
                    the trees, oversaturated greens even with the gray sky following nearby. <br><br>I cried on the phone with my mother saying she wished she had more time to know me 
                    as an adult. I keep getting struck by the realization that I don't live there, and my mother is lonely. <br><br>I forget I am not there, but I do not know how to be <i>here</i> anymore.

                    6/5/22: It is raining harder now, and I suppose it's June Sixth already. Oh well. I turned in my last final over 11 minutes before it was due- (a incoherent mess where the essay I was writing in my mind couldn't match the paper). 
                    Immediately after I felt nothing. I had so much built up into finishing my finals. Now I am left with a horrible feeling coming over me. I drew, worked on the blog, and ate some chicken soup, but I can't help but feel some Void is outside 
                    in the downpour staring at me through my blinds. I am trying to find peace in some rhythm of the rain. I used to cherish the days it'd rain when I was a kid. I find myself wondering when this Something lurking in hidden corners 
                    will come out and confront me now that I no longer have essays to procrastinate and hyperfocus on. <br><br> It is hard when doing better means being more present. I'm so tired sometimes. I can't keep having staring contests with my closed windows 
                    waiting for Reverence in the rain to reveal the next fight while my life falls to the tides again.

                    6/4/22: I cannot focus on my imminent final but I think I am finally able to cry about Adam's death. It was a year and a half ago, and I found out the news around people and ending my own shitty thingy with a guy. 
                    I have little things that remind me of him around my apartment: A candle for the Saint Guadalupe I bought because I remembered him mentioning her, a small sticky frog toy he threw at me one day, and a little voo doo doll I still keep in 
                    the same backpack. I still sometimes think about the last text he sent me. "She may be a saint in a few years." (talking about mayonaise) <br><center>__________</center><br> I just went back and reread all our texts, and honestly it made me feel better. I hadn't looked 
                    at our texts besides the last one next to his name since he passed. We were joking about furies, vaping through masks, and god being dead. The texts made me happy to have known him, even for the short amount of time I did. 
                    I felt weird telling people about wanting to get a tattoo to honor him, but he impacted me, and I am going to get a goddamn meditating frog on my arm for him. And maybe I should actually try mediating. Adam, I hope you have some peace now. Thank you 
                    for talking to me about life and writing and your Kurt Cobain interview that got taken and destroyed, and for wanting to know me too.

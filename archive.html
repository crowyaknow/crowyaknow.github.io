                             I planted a tree outside your old house. <br>
                             I can't bring myself to visit. <br>
                             How could I bear the site of that possibly porous moss<br>
                             masquerading passive<br>
                             unsure itself what it is.<br><br>
                             I'm told the new owners of the house plan to tear down the tree anyhow.<br>
                             Something about Feng Shui and rotting wood.

Of fabrics I would never see-<br><br>
Of the molecule, atom familiar to me 360,000 years ago that I haven't kept in contact since:<br><br>
Things have just been so <i>hectic</i>-<br><br>
And I just got <i>busy</i>-<br><br>
You know how these cells and cell maintenance can be...
<h3>Hero's Journey: Giving into the Goodness Before Climax</h3> 

I miss the particles that knew my soul before the amalgamation of any function, before any experience to travel through me.

I wish sometimes to be touching all of them-to lie in a California King with every cell, every atom, every proton neutron electron, quirk-lying on top of me. I think I'd feel felt. I'd feel some sense of peace. I'd feel everything all at once, bee see feel all that could be conceived. It would surpass overwhelming into all-encompassing;<br><br>

The lines would blur between all and me; I'd myself even be on me-<br>
Somewhere in the pile of it All,<br>
And right when the feeling of rest would come to me...

<h3>Hero's Journey: Come Back Changed, or You're Not a Hero</h3> 
My alarm would go off<br><br>

and I'd wake up.<br><br>

Hollow, Full BedSpring<br><br>

Sunlight and Screaming and Construction; the life outside<br><br><br>

With the horrible terms of <i>this</i> settling on my being:<br><br>
<b>The All of Existence wont come to me.<br><br>
I must go out;<br><br>


With my dread receding soul telling me<br><br>

"You won't."</b></center>

                     isn't there something terrifying about it??? There's a helpless sense of familiarity that you can't quite root, or maybe it's the dizzying realization that this is some set of circumstances that was fated, unavoidable. The paralyzing fear that you know what is about to happen, but you have no control over it. When you turn your head in the scene, hoping to shake off the eerie sense of this inexplicable knowing, you are unsure if you will be sinking in more of the same feeling, or if you will be phase back into the experience of living you usually coast along on.

                        <br> I suppose my view of deja vu could be connected to the overall weariness of my soul. I feel/felt (am, will, have) the helpless, wretched exhaustion of something far within.
                        Perhaps then, Deja vu, and my feelings toward the experience is one that only momentarily reminds me that I've been here before, am here now, and will I be here again? In this point, brought about through consequences of an inconceivable amount of dominos, I am overlapping. Bestowed little more than this feeling of unpinned recognition, I feel found, but subsequently and sinkingly I am aware that I was lost, and am about to be again.

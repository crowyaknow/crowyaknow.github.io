                Merriam-Webster defines <i>prose</i> as that writing you couldn't quite place, that transcended a slot in your notebook, sprang past your own tele-curriculum meanings, and constitutes the ramblings of gargled Angel words still imprinted on your forming mind.</center>

                        isn't there something terrifying about it??? There's a helpless sense of familiarity that you can't quite root, or maybe it's the dizzying realization that this is some set of circumstances that was fated, unavoidable. The paralyzing fear that you know what is about to happen, but you have no control over it. When you turn your head in the scene, hoping to shake off the eerie sense of this inexplicable knowing, you are unsure if you will be sinking in more of the same feeling, or if you will be phase back into the experience of living you usually coast along on.
                       <br><br> I suppose my view of deja vu could be connected to the overall weariness of my soul. I feel/felt (am, will, have) the helpless, wretched exhaustion of something far within.
                        Perhaps then, Deja vu, and my feelings toward the experience is one that only momentarily reminds me that I've been here before, am here now, and will I be here again? In this point, brought about through consequences of an inconceivable amount of dominos, I am overlapping. Bestowed little more than this feeling of unpinned recognition, I feel found, but subsequently and sinkingly I am aware that I was lost, and am about to be again.

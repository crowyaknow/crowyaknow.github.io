                Merriam-Webster defines <i>prose</i> as that writing you couldn't quite place, that transcended a slot in your notebook, sprang past your own tele-curriculum meanings, and constitutes the ramblings of gargled Angel words still imprinted on your forming mind.</center>

                        isn't there something terrifying about it??? There's a helpless sense of familiarity that you can't quite root, or maybe it's the dizzying realization that this is some set of circumstances that was fated, unavoidable. The paralyzing fear that you know what is about to happen, but you have no control over it. When you turn your head in the scene, hoping to shake off the eerie sense of this inexplicable knowing, you are unsure if you will be sinking in more of the same feeling, or if you will be phase back into the experience of living you usually coast along on.
                       <br><br> I suppose my view of deja vu could be connected to the overall weariness of my soul. I feel/felt (am, will, have) the helpless, wretched exhaustion of something far within.
                        Perhaps then, Deja vu, and my feelings toward the experience is one that only momentarily reminds me that I've been here before, am here now, and will I be here again? In this point, brought about through consequences of an inconceivable amount of dominos, I am overlapping. Bestowed little more than this feeling of unpinned recognition, I feel found, but subsequently and sinkingly I am aware that I was lost, and am about to be again.

                         <br>i thought about what u said after dy said your car smelled like her grandpa's car and she was quick to say in a good way and you excitedly said ahh but this <i>was</i> my grandparent's car and the smell does sometimes take me back to my grandparents taking me to swimming lessons and i considered what it was to perhaps be living within varied states of nostalgia,,<br><br> maybe it is comparable to an experience like <b>deja vu</b> that removes us from whatever treadmill of consciousness we usually stroll on and lands us somewhere that is a point we have brought to overlap to the now us,,<br><br> unlike deja vu's dizzying familiarity, nostalgia is a hazy sigh,, it's sweeter,, maybe because we can place the familiarty or becauze our brains have only experienced certain triggers in our past ,, like a specific smell as the catalyst or a phrase or even a word (hopefully not a name as those are quick to be sullied) nostalgia is more specific,, unlike the general shifty nature of deja vu

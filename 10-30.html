                    6/1/22: I just got hit so hard with deja vu while typing out the word "New!!" on the homepage while listening to for "Adeline" by alt-J. It was 
                    only my second time listening to the song over, but I have this feeling on my arms listening to it (goosebumps?). THANKS A LOT [REDACTED]! <br><br>
                    Today I talked with a friend about time repeating and the consistent cycles. They orbit us so quickly like electrons. We are not even able to see them, 
                    we only have some cloud of understanding we have to try to control in order to add/subtract/connect and form a new compounds for our lives . *Wowza*, English majors be like, 
                    "I am going to use my 9th grade understanding of biology to make a metaphor about Cycles."<br><br> I also talked to that same friend 
                    about feeling like costant deja vu with small things like Youtube videos, but I said maybe it could be becasue of some dissosio haze that makes this all feels like deja vu... 
                    But time could still be repeating? I could be remembering, or overlapping with another me. My soul could be falling asleep and waking up. I want to wake up, but I think I am being 
                    unceremoniously drowned in the kiddie pool only to be revived with a smile and thrown back in. My soul feels like it is constantly laundry day and I am your favorite band 
                    t-shirt your dad gave you that you just can't part with. <br><br>
                    I made some changes to the website! Rendition 0.95 is in action! I gravely need sleep though (and should be putting pyschic energy toward my final but ah! here I am!)<br><br>
                   To Conclude though: I think I cannot stop myself from wanting to believe time cycles, multiverse, and tigers (oh my!) because as much as I lean into the clutches of following nihilism and chaos theory,
                    there feels like some pull behind the curtain that I cannot define or deny. 
                    As the poster of my MCM states "I Want To Believe."

                        5/11/22: I always liked watching planes take off. I remember landing with my friend in California for camp, and we had to wait with the other 
                        saps who flew in for camp. Luckily, we were waiting with a very tall fellow I would later riff for too long about cults with. In my facing the window 
                        I screamed with glee seeing a plane take off so close. Naturally, my friend and tall dude <i>had</i> to bully me for getting so shocked by a plane taking off, 
                        but it just caught me off guard and filled me with such emotion. I think I told them it didn't seem real. How could a plane land or take flight looking like that? 
                        It made no sense, but filled me some wonder. How could I forget looking up at a seagull flying either right before or after that period of time, thinking there was <i>no way</i>. 
                        No way this seagull was flying like that. It looked like he was on a string. I felt for a moment the world around me dissolve into a million wires and screens, sparking 
                        and glitching out. The world, a mere series of coils and wires, screens and jellyfish-like conciousnesses bundles of cable chords and metal. I started writing a story on the beach 
                        that day with the seagull. I didn't get very far, but I got a prologue of a main character as a child in 1st grade (of course I was picturing my own first grade setting). 
                        Walking in line in the hall one day, the main character would fall behind the class stare intensely before seeing throughout the hall loose wires hanging, a few of those jellyfishes floating through 
                        the air, and ceiling panels open and overflowing with cables. The scene would glitch back to the "reality" before as the teacher catches the main character 
                        lagging behind and pulls them into class. <br> Am I saying this ever happened to me? No. But do I find corners of rooms fascinating and find myself staring into them 
                        like the peppermint butler dude in Adventure Time leading them into the underworld? Not exactly..

                        5/5/22: Today necessitated laundry, and the rain lifted in the evening. Waitng 18 minutes for the dryer to ding, I found myself 
                        underground, in the warm belly of the churning laundry room. Feeling someone was always around the corner, I felt myself tittering within the space. 
                        I found two detective books sitting a top pie pans and next to some soap dispensers that had a definitively New Mexico feel. 
                        Reading the backs of the books and flipping to random pages, I found myself thrown into gritty and fast pace banter as the dectectives did more to 
                        tell people what had/was happening than rather than investigate anything. There was also an obligatory page about how things are differnt now, but this ole 
                        detective doesn't rely on technology--no sir--he does some good ole fashion surveillance and illegal witness intimidation. <br><br>
                        I think I need to branch out of my wheelhouse of genres. There is something to be said about diving into a supposed structure of work I only have the vaguest 
                        notions of without having ever touched any of the original material. Perhaps this is my sign to write the next great film noir style story, or just to fill 
                        shelves at grocery stores with something less abhorant but equally as tantalizing and wish-fulfilling as these detective novels.<br>
                      <center>____________</center><br>
                        <i> But how could I expect to solve anything,</i> when the greatest mystery still remained: Who am I outside my own utility? I fear this case would 
                           run cold the longer I couldn't catch a grip on this whole thing. Maybe it was pointless. A mystery outside my control. A question remaining stangnant, unwavering, and unanswerable 
                           as the answer lies hidden somewhere dying in obscurity. Maybe this whole time <i>I</i> was the answer, and in my own prophetic way I'll die alone and away from anyone I could 
                           be shown through as an answer to...<br><br>
                           Or maybe my bitch ex-wife would find me and force me to pay the goddamn alimony checks after I already faked my death in LA again. Who's to say?

                        5/4/22: Can I get a May the Fourth be with you in the chat? Today and yesterday the weather has been so loverly (yes loverly,
                        the way I pronounced "lovely" in my 5th grade solo as I sang in a British accent). I wandered around Reed for a while 
                        and sat in a field staring at a very lovely tree for some time. And Today I woke up freezing and came outside to find 70 degrees and sun.
                        I pulled out my matrix red sunglasses and felt very swell.<br> <br>For DnD, I talked with our DM and worked on some new ideas. I think 
                        I am going to have a possessed doll with my bard character who plays music on a pull string and also gaslights me when no one else can hear her talk. 
                        I am super exicted and may bring in Haddie for sessions!<br><br> I also started sewing my dress pattern this past weekend. 
                        As I ironed the thrifted fabric to work with it, I realized it smelled like the china cabinet at my parent's house. I watched a three hour 
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/SL3eWPXVs50" target="_blank">Youtube video on Beastars</a> while I was sewing and 
                        it was such a lovely video and youtuber; I teared up at the end. It made me want to read  
                        Beastars since the show seems to cut out or skip over a lot of things that the manga explores more. I am still upset that I don't have the 
                        first book in another manga series that I bought a few books of a few years ago. I only have 2-5, and  I think the first book may be lost in places I used to be. 
                        Unable to start again, I melt toward another between.

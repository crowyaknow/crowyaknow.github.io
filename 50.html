                    6/15/22: What an insanely ~namebrand~ <b>"Bri"</b> moment of checking out in the thrift store with the person in full-face crying clown makeup and overalls holding a giant wooden racoon painting and the other person talking about walkie talkies, wills to live, and their clown horn. 
                    It was such an uproar of events that would supposedly be integral to my many identities and sensibilities, but I just felt disconnected from the moment. Like it wasn't for me. Like it was far too much of a sitcom moment where the main character (me) 
                    is attempting to get something simple done while getting caught up in a very *on brand* swirl of chaos. <br><br> Right when life was feeling more like a thought than the action, the world picks up a paintbrush to place me in a surrealism painting that binds me to it with every stroke. Only 
                    after could I reach the frame of the painting to look upon it (picture a Bob Ross animation type beat here).<Br><br> I also must express my love for the wall of flowers by the bus stop 
                       with so many different bees buzzing around. I feel like I never know where to look while existing in public spaces, but the flowers and bees gave me small-winged journeys to occupy my gaze. I forget how much easier it is to endure existing around others with sunglasses on (♫ <i>so put your sunglasses on 'cuz you're a deer in the headlights</i> ♫) <br><br>
                       --going back to the painting, I wonder how I looked, standing at the cashier in that moment, or in any moment. I can attempt to look upon myself in the mirror or dissosiating, but the astral projecting only gets me so far.

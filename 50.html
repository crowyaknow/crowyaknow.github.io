I could craft new stories, but how to feel connected to it? I could spark stories before. They used to unfurl 
                   before my eyes. I saw the events through some other way of seeing then. The trouble was finding a mode to communicate the "visions-ish". I have not known which methods would materialize them best, but if I could even just wind a semblence of them into reality; that would be enough. Life has just been running up that hill (no, not that hill) as a 
                   persistent attempt at communication. My mouth couldn't form the words for anyone to understand until lessons and tongue curls. Consciously consciously pronouncing every word, but writing was always better, easier, indirect in a brilliant way. Drawing, visuals, acting, performing: Any way to get the point across.. A built-in audience in certain settings has pros to captivating your own. How To Guide. <br><br>
                   How to make connections with the others in the collectives. you're a cell. if you don't make the connections you will not be used. you will die. you will die. you will die. Perogative: connect.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> perogative is being used somewhat "incorrectly" here to mean: <i>objective/purpose/goal</i> rather than the word "PRErogative"- def: <i>An exclusive right or privilege held by a person or group, especially a hereditary or official right.</i>

                    religious scrubbing of the sink at one am because the palette with black powder has blue glitter broken across every color--I endure the blue crumbles scratching every surface with every moment for this brief perfect curl of hair framing my face at the end of the day when the character

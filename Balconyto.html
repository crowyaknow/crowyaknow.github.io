                        5/1/22: MARS ARGO HAS RELEASED NEW MUSIC ON SPOTIFY!!! AND MARINA PUT EVOL ON SPOTIFY??<br>
                        The EMO middle schooler inside me is rejoicing! I think I need to start up a music/song/ablum review/ranting page!
                        A εїз fellow blog εїз just put up an album review, and it brought me a lot of joy to just go into their
                        mind as they go into every song on the album. I want to sit down and listen to some of these songs and go back to read the song reviews.
                        It is kinda beautiful that album reviews and music and blogs is just another way to record and remember. I think a lot of life 
                        is just wanting to remember--which is a thought that struck me so intensely many moons ago in a haze. Humans are just silly little 
                        fellows wanting to remember and be remembered.
                        <br><br>
                        I am kinda drawing a blank as far as my religion for DnD--Everything I think of has some kind of technology/daddy god AI/simulation/
                        we-are-just-being-used-to-fuel-a-car-battery-in-an-alchololic's-car type vibes. I am thinking maybe the whole devotion to the religion 
                        could be rooted in one piece of album with certain lines of songs being 'scripture' 
                        and everyone playing is more confused with how and why these lyrics are here. As the game goes on, it can be revealed that 
                        I have a walkman with this one album that I think is   
                        sent from some entity/god specifically to me to be a prophet, but really it is just a rip in space time continuum from some 
                        man from our dimension who was testing out interdimensional travel.<br><br> 
                        Okay actually, I think typing this out here helped me come up with some ideas. Now I just need to decide on an album to use 
                        (Or maybe I could pick a selection of songs and have the casette be a mixtape!) Oh no, you know who thought an album was prophetic? 
                        Me in 2019 but also Charles Manson... Oh no

                        4/30/22: The past few days I have not been able to sleep or get work done. I am in a constant state of being
                        between waking reality and that of a sleeping mind. I watched some jumpscares on Youtube in an attempt to wake myself up.
                         I am almost done with my last
                        assignment that has been haunting me this week, then slumber will be my friend again. I just want a fulfilling sleep
                        and to not be half in and out of unconsciousness. <br><br>
                        On a brighter note, I think I am going to start playing DnD with some friends, and I may be a monk just 
                        so I can form an entire religion centering around me :)<br><br>
                        Okay, I suppose I must return diligently to this elusive assignment, but before I go--my song of last night was
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aki1Xn36eJ8" target="_blank">"♫ Andromeda ♫ by Weyes Blood"</a>
                        I already know this is going to be my most played song of 2022, and there is so much to unpack with it.
                        I may have to dedicate an entire page to this song just so the intense trance-like state in which this song puts 
                        me in while I am dancing and crying may be fully understood. <br><br>
                        Until then,<br> Peace!

                        people and we all talked quite a bit.  Right now someone is attempting to play ♫ "Merry Go Round of Life" ♫
                        from <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> on the flute outside, and the crows are loving it (as am I, the biggest crow, ya know?

                        4/25/22: Today, bad things swirled around and were pinned down by something of reality. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I watched <i>Donnie Darko</i> yesterday. There was some very abhorant and unexplored racism in the film? I don't
                        remember it being that jarring the first time I watched it, but the racism and storyline with that character
                        is never really fully flushed out or acknowledged outside of the character being a possible foil for Donnie's younger sister 
                        and having a crush on Donnie? I feel like the movie
                        was also more shallow than I remember. I kept waiting for it to dig its teeth into something, but it felt like the
                        whole movie was floating on water.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am feeling very doomy today. I did a lot of coding and feel actually motivated to sit down and work on this bad boy
                        (even though a theme for Empty Halls seems to evade me still-- I enjoy the gothic, almost unfunctionally absurd complicatedness
                        going on right now). I feel more connected to people, but being more bound to people and this reality in general just makes me feel
                        kinda heavy. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I tried to clean the old battery spillage in my Casio keyboard
                        and I bought a bunch of new D batteries, but I don't know if I can revive the keyboard this time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Tomorrow I am hoping my chest won't feel so heavy. But saying "heavy" reminds me of Florence+the Machine's song 
                        "Heavy In Your Arms" with one of my favorite lines, <br><br>

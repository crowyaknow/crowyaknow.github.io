                    6/19/22: You think you're somewhere floating in the middle. What would make you think different? But you don't sense the ground right beneath your back. You aren't soaking properly, evenly. When you're pulled out, the effect won't quite be right, and they'll have to 
                    plunge you back in the depths to age the thousand year statue you are just a little longer in the sea. I think I am upset that my oreo (gluten free+doublestuf) sat at the bottom of my milk (almond+chocolate) and thus only the top part soaked the milk, leaving the bottom dry, sad, and just wrong. 
                    I feel I've aged improperly, marinated incorrectly. I have been substituted, no longer using soy lecithin to hold together the milky way (fun size) bar of self-
                    <br><br>On  <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder#:~:text=Hallucinogen%20persisting%20perception%20disorder%20(HPPD,a%20previous%20hallucinogenic%20drug%20experience." target="_blank">wikipedia</a>, the only two people with HPPD is Andrew from Channel 5, and, of course, Rust from s1 of 'True Detective'.
                The reappearance of the character of <i>Rust</i>. I somewhat subconsciously seemed to have dated someone similar to him. I have the last conversation of the show printed out from when I was 17/18 for journaling.<br><br>I could consider this phenomenon/motif in my life of the repeating quiet, thoughtful Alaska loner contemplating good and evil, but I need to get these colors on my hair. TO BE CONTINUED.
                Pinky promise no Alexander Supertramp vibes, though Andrew from Channel 5 talked about his experience after college hitchhiking and traveling around the US and I ON THE OTHER HAND cannot leave my house so no worries I suppose. I wish I had that same restlessness that let me wander the waterfront talking to people and watching.<br><br> I drew the meditation center next to the highway and busy intersection, but 
                the moment of connection with the person at the store did not carry me as much as the dread thought of going home to be absorbed back into the amoeba. The drawing of buildings is good grounding. Summers ago, I accidentally stumbled upon the end of pride and sat drawing the building that 
                stood out to me half a year before then (the first time I came to the city). A guy sat next to me trying to talk to me (right outside of a pride festival? okay my guy), and I just kept drawing and not really responding. He eventually got the hint and said something to the effect of, you just want to draw, huh, I'll leave you alone. And I remember 
                feeling happy the drawing saved me from having to engaged with some bozo. I don't think I need to go outside for my own interactions with other people as much as the general taking in of places, people, interactions, trees, cloud formations, branches, bird formations, and sunlight for the translation of these things to paper. To ground myself, to be/feel/am real. That is what I think I need to do. NEW PEROGATIVE: Translation.

                    Immediately after I felt nothing. I had so much built up into finishing my finals. Now I am left with a horrible feeling coming over me. I drew, worked on the blog, and ate some chicken soup, but I can't help but feel some Void is outside

                    I have little things that remind me of him around my apartment: A candle for the Saint Guadalupe I bought because I remembered him mentioning her, a small sticky frog toy he threw at me one day, and a little voo doo doll I still keep in 
                    the same backpack. I still sometimes think about the last text he sent me. "She may be a saint in a few years." (talking about mayonaise) <br><center>__________</center><br> I just went back and reread all our texts, and honestly it made me feel better. I hadn't looked 
                    at our texts besides the last one next to his name since he passed. We were joking about furies, vaping through masks, and god being dead. The texts made me happy to have known him, even for the short amount of time I did. 
                    I felt weird telling people about wanting to get a tattoo to honor him, but he impacted me, and I am going to get a goddamn meditating frog on my arm for him. And maybe I should actually try mediating. Adam, I hope you have some peace now. Thank you 
                    for talking to me about life and writing and your Kurt Cobain interview that got taken and destroyed, and for wanting to know me too.

                    only my second time listening to the song over, but I have this feeling on my arms listening to it (goosebumps?). THANKS A LOT [REDACTED]! <br><br>
                    Today I talked with a friend about time repeating and the consistent cycles. They orbit us so quickly like electrons. We are not even able to see them, 
                    we only have some cloud of understanding we have to try to control in order to add/subtract/connect and form a new compounds for our lives . *Wowza*, English majors be like,

                    about feeling like costant deja vu with small things like Youtube videos, but I said maybe it could be becasue of some dissosio haze that makes this all feels like deja vu... 
                    But time could still be repeating? I could be remembering, or overlapping with another me. My soul could be falling asleep and waking up. I want to wake up, but I think I am being 
                    unceremoniously drowned in the kiddie pool only to be revived with a smile and thrown back in. My soul feels like it is constantly laundry day and I am your favorite band 
                    t-shirt your dad gave you that you just can't part with. <br><br>
                    I made some changes to the website! Rendition 0.95 is in action! I gravely need sleep though (and should be putting pyschic energy toward my final but ah! here I am!)<br><br>
                   To Conclude though: I think I cannot stop myself from wanting to believe time cycles, multiverse, and tigers (oh my!) because as much as I lean into the clutches of following nihilism and chaos theory,
                    there feels like some pull behind the curtain that I cannot define or deny. 
                    As the poster of my MCM states "I Want To Believe."

                        5/11/22: I always liked watching planes take off. I remember landing with my friend in California for camp, and we had to wait with the other 
                        saps who flew in for camp. Luckily, we were waiting with a very tall fellow I would later riff for too long about cults with. In my facing the window 
                        I screamed with glee seeing a plane take off so close. Naturally, my friend and tall dude <i>had</i> to bully me for getting so shocked by a plane taking off, 
                        but it just caught me off guard and filled me with such emotion. I think I told them it didn't seem real. How could a plane land or take flight looking like that? 
                        It made no sense, but filled me some wonder. How could I forget looking up at a seagull flying either right before or after that period of time, thinking there was <i>no way</i>. 
                        No way this seagull was flying like that. It looked like he was on a string. I felt for a moment the world around me dissolve into a million wires and screens, sparking 
                        and glitching out. The world, a mere series of coils and wires, screens and jellyfish-like conciousnesses bundles of cable chords and metal. I started writing a story on the beach 
                        that day with the seagull. I didn't get very far, but I got a prologue of a main character as a child in 1st grade (of course I was picturing my own first grade setting). 
                        Walking in line in the hall one day, the main character would fall behind the class stare intensely before seeing throughout the hall loose wires hanging, a few of those jellyfishes floating through 
                        the air, and ceiling panels open and overflowing with cables. The scene would glitch back to the "reality" before as the teacher catches the main character 
                        lagging behind and pulls them into class. <br> Am I saying this ever happened to me? No. But do I find corners of rooms fascinating and find myself staring into them 
                        like the peppermint butler dude in Adventure Time leading them into the underworld? Not exactly..

                        5/5/22: Today necessitated laundry, and the rain lifted in the evening. Waitng 18 minutes for the dryer to ding, I found myself 
                        underground, in the warm belly of the churning laundry room. Feeling someone was always around the corner, I felt myself tittering within the space. 
                        I found two detective books sitting a top pie pans and next to some soap dispensers that had a definitively New Mexico feel. 
                        Reading the backs of the books and flipping to random pages, I found myself thrown into gritty and fast pace banter as the dectectives did more to 
                        tell people what had/was happening than rather than investigate anything. There was also an obligatory page about how things are differnt now, but this ole 
                        detective doesn't rely on technology--no sir--he does some good ole fashion surveillance and illegal witness intimidation. <br><br>
                        I think I need to branch out of my wheelhouse of genres. There is something to be said about diving into a supposed structure of work I only have the vaguest 
                        notions of without having ever touched any of the original material. Perhaps this is my sign to write the next great film noir style story, or just to fill 
                        shelves at grocery stores with something less abhorant but equally as tantalizing and wish-fulfilling as these detective novels.<br>
                      <center>____________</center><br>
                        <i> But how could I expect to solve anything,</i> when the greatest mystery still remained: Who am I outside my own utility? I fear this case would 
                           run cold the longer I couldn't catch a grip on this whole thing. Maybe it was pointless. A mystery outside my control. A question remaining stangnant, unwavering, and unanswerable 
                           as the answer lies hidden somewhere dying in obscurity. Maybe this whole time <i>I</i> was the answer, and in my own prophetic way I'll die alone and away from anyone I could 
                           be shown through as an answer to...<br><br>
                           Or maybe my bitch ex-wife would find me and force me to pay the goddamn alimony checks after I already faked my death in LA again. Who's to say?

                        the way I pronounced "lovely" in my 5th grade solo as I sang in a British accent). I wandered around Reed for a while 
                        and sat in a field staring at a very lovely tree for some time. And Today I woke up freezing and came outside to find 70 degrees and sun.
                        I pulled out my matrix red sunglasses and felt very swell.<br> <br>For DnD, I talked with our DM and worked on some new ideas. I think 
                        I am going to have a possessed doll with my bard character who plays music on a pull string and also gaslights me when no one else can hear her talk. 
                        I am super exicted and may bring in Haddie for sessions!<br><br> I also started sewing my dress pattern this past weekend. 
                        As I ironed the thrifted fabric to work with it, I realized it smelled like the china cabinet at my parent's house. I watched a three hour 
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/SL3eWPXVs50" target="_blank">Youtube video on Beastars</a> while I was sewing and 
                        it was such a lovely video and youtuber; I teared up at the end. It made me want to read  
                        Beastars since the show seems to cut out or skip over a lot of things that the manga explores more. I am still upset that I don't have the 
                        first book in another manga series that I bought a few books of a few years ago. I only have 2-5, and  I think the first book may be lost in places I used to be. 
                        Unable to start again, I melt toward another between.

                        <br> The way Beach Plum LaCroix embodies my life is something so brilliant that I almost missed. Canned Apriocot juice from my 
                        childhood with the hummingbird on the label. Summer camp camping stealing plums from the Penske. The beach beckoning, a siren unto herself
                         with distance industrial boobs too. The train rattling through my dreams into the present. The trip I didn't want to take and the 
                         beach where I felt the possiblity of peace again. Please bury me with my LaCroix Beach Plum. Oh, for the intersecting of my life to be canned up like this.
                         The carbonationed slight flavor I scorned for flat oversaturated drinks that got me sugar high and left me feeling sticky and heavy. Who knew 
                         this would be the liquid of choice for my burial customization?<br><br>
                         I feel I probably knew. When you find something that just intersects at all the right points in your life, it is hard not to believe some God or gods or  
                         chaos personified is grinning at you expectantly when these things happen. When you walk into a moment, leaving your kitchen-say, and the scene around you is 
                         definitively a dream you had, with the same inherent, inexplicable feelings from the dream that you are living through now, arrived to now. <br><br>
                         That one poetry class really made me insufferable because I cannnot stop connecting two poems from that term.
                         <a href="https://poems.com/poem/you-who-never-arrived/" target="_blank">"You who never arrived" by Rilke</a> and of course

                        5/1/22: MARS ARGO HAS RELEASED NEW MUSIC ON SPOTIFY!!! AND MARINA PUT EVOL ON SPOTIFY??<br>
                        The EMO middle schooler inside me is rejoicing! I think I need to start up a music/song/ablum review/ranting page!
                        A εїз fellow blog εїз just put up an album review, and it brought me a lot of joy to just go into their
                        mind as they go into every song on the album. I want to sit down and listen to some of these songs and go back to read the song reviews.
                        It is kinda beautiful that album reviews and music and blogs is just another way to record and remember. I think a lot of life 
                        is just wanting to remember--which is a thought that struck me so intensely many moons ago in a haze. Humans are just silly little 
                        fellows wanting to remember and be remembered.
                        <br><br>
                        I am kinda drawing a blank as far as my religion for DnD--Everything I think of has some kind of technology/daddy god AI/simulation/
                        we-are-just-being-used-to-fuel-a-car-battery-in-an-alchololic's-car type vibes. I am thinking maybe the whole devotion to the religion 
                        could be rooted in one piece of album with certain lines of songs being 'scripture' 
                        and everyone playing is more confused with how and why these lyrics are here. As the game goes on, it can be revealed that 
                        I have a walkman with this one album that I think is   
                        sent from some entity/god specifically to me to be a prophet, but really it is just a rip in space time continuum from some 
                        man from our dimension who was testing out interdimensional travel.<br><br> 
                        Okay actually, I think typing this out here helped me come up with some ideas. Now I just need to decide on an album to use 
                        (Or maybe I could pick a selection of songs and have the casette be a mixtape!) Oh no, you know who thought an album was prophetic? 
                        Me in 2019 but also Charles Manson... Oh no

                        4/30/22: The past few days I have not been able to sleep or get work done. I am in a constant state of being
                        between waking reality and that of a sleeping mind. I watched some jumpscares on Youtube in an attempt to wake myself up.
                         I am almost done with my last
                        assignment that has been haunting me this week, then slumber will be my friend again. I just want a fulfilling sleep
                        and to not be half in and out of unconsciousness. <br><br>
                        On a brighter note, I think I am going to start playing DnD with some friends, and I may be a monk just 
                        so I can form an entire religion centering around me :)<br><br>
                        Okay, I suppose I must return diligently to this elusive assignment, but before I go--my song of last night was
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aki1Xn36eJ8" target="_blank">"♫ Andromeda ♫ by Weyes Blood"</a>
                        I already know this is going to be my most played song of 2022, and there is so much to unpack with it.
                        I may have to dedicate an entire page to this song just so the intense trance-like state in which this song puts 
                        me in while I am dancing and crying may be fully understood. <br><br>

                        I tried to clean the old battery spillage in my Casio keyboard

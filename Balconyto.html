                        4/25/22: Today, bad things swirled around and were pinned down by something of reality. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I watched <i>Donnie Darko</i> yesterday. There was some very abhorant and unexplored racism in the film? I don't
                        remember it being that jarring the first time I watched it, but the racism and storyline with that character
                        is never really fully flushed out or acknowledged outside of the character being a possible foil for Donnie's younger sister 
                        and having a crush on Donnie? I feel like the movie
                        was also more shallow than I remember. I kept waiting for it to dig its teeth into something, but it felt like the
                        whole movie was floating on water.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am feeling very doomy today. I did a lot of coding and feel actually motivated to sit down and work on this bad boy
                        (even though a theme for Empty Halls seems to evade me still-- I enjoy the gothic, almost unfunctionally absurd complicatedness
                        going on right now). I feel more connected to people, but being more bound to people and this reality in general just makes me feel
                        kinda heavy. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I tried to clean the old battery spillage in my Casio keyboard
                        and I bought a bunch of new D batteries, but I don't know if I can revive the keyboard this time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Tomorrow I am hoping my chest won't feel so heavy. But saying "heavy" reminds me of Florence+the Machine's song 
                        "Heavy In Your Arms" with one of my favorite lines, 
                        <h3>"This will be my last confession, I love you never felt like any blessing."</h3>
                        So much to unpack there but as the old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLqwUC26Klk" target="_blank">commercial</a> goes-- too much stuff, not enough space!

                walking around and the shifting foilage friends (birds and squirrels! but fuck seagulls). You are left with thoughts of
                someone who loses time staring at branches like god.

                        people and we all talked quite a bit.  Right now someone is attempting to play ♫ "Merry Go Round of Life" ♫
                        from <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> on the flute outside, and the crows are loving it (as am I, the biggest crow, ya know?

                        4/25/22: Today, bad things swirled around and were pinned down by something of reality. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I watched <i>Donnie Darko</i> yesterday. There was some very abhorant and unexplored racism in the film? I don't
                        remember it being that jarring the first time I watched it, but the racism and storyline with that character
                        is never really fully flushed out or acknowledged outside of the character being a possible foil for Donnie's younger sister 
                        and having a crush on Donnie? I feel like the movie
                        was also more shallow than I remember. I kept waiting for it to dig its teeth into something, but it felt like the
                        whole movie was floating on water.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am feeling very doomy today. I did a lot of coding and feel actually motivated to sit down and work on this bad boy
                        (even though a theme for Empty Halls seems to evade me still-- I enjoy the gothic, almost unfunctionally absurd complicatedness
                        going on right now). I feel more connected to people, but being more bound to people and this reality in general just makes me feel
                        kinda heavy. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I tried to clean the old battery spillage in my Casio keyboard
                        and I bought a bunch of new D batteries, but I don't know if I can revive the keyboard this time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Tomorrow I am hoping my chest won't feel so heavy. But saying "heavy" reminds me of Florence+the Machine's song 
                        "Heavy In Your Arms" with one of my favorite lines, <br><br>
                        <center>♫ "This will be my last confession, I love you never felt like any blessing." ♫</center><br>

                         I could never be the Shape of the something;<br><br>
                         I could never even be--<br><br>
                         Out of naivety idealized,<br>
                         Through dissosio haze<br><br>
                         Consistently gleaming from your dashboard<br>
                         That I would not Shape<br><br>
                         I thought in the past I could've done it easy, <br>
                         fall on no. 3<br><br>
                         But that was a fault of her<br>
                         not me, looking back--<br><br>
                         Thought I'd chosen the path<br>
                         To be some <i>thing</i> more than Shape.<br><br>
                         In my rebellion I could not tell, again!<br>

                            I planted a tree outside your old house. <br>
                            I can't bring myself to visit. <br>
                            How could I bear the site of that possibly porous moss<br>
                            masquerading passive<br>
                            unsure itself what it is.<br><br>
                            I'm told the new owners of the house plan to tear down the tree anyhow.<br>
                            Something about Feng Shui and rotting wood.

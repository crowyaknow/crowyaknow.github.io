            <center>Wow, who goes to open the locker? You must really think you are such a truly inquisitive intuitive angel baby!
                <br>Here, take some poetry you would find crammed in the back of a composition notebook scrawled out by someone
                more unhinged than your middle school locker.

                            The radio was monotonous as ever 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The tanks rolled through broken streets and cracked pavement 
                            <br>
                            Strange lights from the North violated every window

                            I laid 
                            <br>
                            paralyzed

                            <br>
                            Mother Earth rioted 
                            <br>
                            Atrocities sought to engulf the fire of Earth with the seas

                            <br>
                            My brain scrambled

                            The fear of the unknown and the inevitable

                            <br>
                            Still, I stayed in bed 
                            <br>
                            Searching for signs in the sounds

                            Now I hear the howling from afar of a train,<br>
                            signalling to someone nearby that they are here<br><br>  
                            they are here<br>
                            but where am I<br>

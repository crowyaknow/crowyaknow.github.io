            <center>Wow, who goes to open the locker? You must really think you are such a truly inquisitive intuitive angel baby!
                <br>Here, take some poetry you would find crammed in the back of a composition notebook scrawled out by someone
                more unhinged than your middle school locker.

                         I could never be the Shape of the something;<br><br>
                         I could never even be--<br><br>
                         Out of naivety idealized,<br>

                         But that was a fault of her<br>
                         not me, looking back--<br><br>
                         Thought I'd chosen the path<br>
                         To be some <i>thing</i> more than Shape.<br><br>
                         In my rebellion I could not tell, again!<br>

                            I can't bring myself to visit. <br>

                            masquerading passive<br>
                            unsure itself what it is.<br><br>
                            I'm told the new owners of the house plan to tear down the tree anyhow.<br>

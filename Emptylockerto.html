            <center>Wow, who goes to open the locker? You must really think you are such a truly inquisitive intuitive angel baby!
                <br>Here, take some poetry you would find crammed in the back of a composition notebook scrawled out by someone
                more unhinged than your middle school locker.

                         I could never even be--<br><br>
                         Out of naivety idealized,<br>

                         fall on no. 3<br><br>
                         But that was a fault of her<br>
                         not me, looking back--<br><br>
                         Thought I'd chosen the path<br>
                         To be some <i>thing</i> more than Shape.<br><br>
                         In my rebellion I could not tell, again!<br>

          <td>A few days ago, the song "Heroine Soup" by Yung Heazy was brought to my attention. Naturally I had to go back to that album 
       and ended up listening to some of the songs from the album <i>Whenever You're Around I Hate Everything Less</i>. My top three choices 
       (besides "Heroine Soup" because fuck you of course that song extends past any heirarchy) are ❶"If I Had a License" ❷"Time" ❸ "Backup Plan". 
       The order is simply how they appear on the album.<br><br>
       ❶ "If I had a Liscence" is longing, it makes me want to cry with the sad sigh that starts the track. It is all of the wishing and all of this 
       acknowledge that loving is pain. Rather than saying something like "Never know the feeling to love someone", the line is 
       repeated in two separate places "Never know the feeling to hurt someone." The song isn't very long or complicated, but it is just a dude singing 
       with all this emotion, and that is what I love.
       <BR>LYRIC OF THE SONG: "So what's the point in making music if all that you fades away?"
        <br><br>
        ❷ "Time" is a song I never finish. I always skip before the end because it is honestly too repetitive. That is kinda the point though to show the 
        passing of time in the repetitive way the smaller incriments fade into the larger ones until years feel like seconds and you are repeating to yourself 
        like the song does "I'm young/Yung" (I don't know if it is young or the name Yung, but either one works, clinging to your youthfulness or your stage identity 
        as a means of grounding yourself as you feel time moving is out of your control.)<br><br>
        ❸ "Backup Plan" also has some similar energy to "If I had a Liscence" but with more gusto and disenchantment (no NOT the song "Disenchantment" by MCR but omg I am going to go listen to THAT song now and cry).
         From the first line, "I wonder which of my friends will give up first/You say it's growing older but we know much worse", Sir Heazy does not let up on the 
         disillusionment seeping through the song as he gazes into the future, but decides "I don't have a backup plan/All I have is in the band."
         Something from this song I want to point out is the line "This will be the final time I relax." Here the music stops and Yung takes a deep breath. 
         Up until a few days ago, I had thought the line was "This will be the final time I relapse." I then interpretted the pause to be people going silent at that uncomfortable assertion before the next line, 
         "Spare another moment I wish I had back" which implied to me before that after relapsing, they would be gone. The line after that "Promise me you'll never find a real job" gets even sadder with my previous 
         understanding of the song: If Heazy, Yung was going to relapse and no longer be here, then he was looking to someone close and making them make promisese to "never get a real job" 
         and in that saying "Dont grow up or give in, for me-since I never had the chance to." My understanding of the future is so much more convoluted than it was when I first heard this song. I don't know. I think 
         the song is a lot less sadder with the word "relax" instead of "relapse", but now the song is almost too sweet, too purely "coming-of-age" disillusionment with "grown-ups" rather than a 
         resigned suicide note that the meaning has shifted too much. But I guess I have shifted too much away from it too.
       <br>
       <br>
       Yung Heazy is not even in my top [insert number] list of artists, but these songs send me back to high school and I laugh at how 
        then I thought this music makes sense. The problem is it makes more sense. Things just make more sense, but the problem is that you 
        thought you understood it before, but it is only just now unraveling revelations to you.
